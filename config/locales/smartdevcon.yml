          description: 
            - For most of the tech world, the Asian market is the new frontier – the region of fast growth and opportunity. A large part of the web world currently seems to evolve around the West, most cutting edge design & technology originates from the US and Europe, whereas the actual user base is spread all over the world and those rather unknown or developing regions offer huge opportunities and potential for growth, especially Asia and its mobile market.
            - My talk will give some insight on the Asian mobile web market, look at mobile & web statistics and user behaviour in comparison to the western world, cultural differences and personal as well as general challenges and pitfalls that I (and others) have encountered along the way.

          title: Sailfish & Mer? Oh, no, not another one!
          description: 
            - Are you asking "Does the market need yet another mobile OS?"Maybe you are interested in what makes it relevant to your device strategy? Or you want to understand (part of) how Jolla can deliver so quickly and efficiently? Of course this is a technology-rich area so you may like a high-level technical perspective. 
            - There will be some background covering Mer's birth, the MeeGo years and how we now work in a truly collaborative and open project to make Mer productisable. The case in point is clearly how Jolla uses Mer in Sailfish. 
            - Mer supports organisational collaboration; our vendor focus drove the design from the project structure through the architecture, the deliverables and the processes. We continuously ask "How will this decision affect vendors using our solution to make a product?" 
            - Mer delivers a world-class platform for building products: after all, it's an ultra-modern Linux stack with a strong upstream focus that partners with Qt, a world-class graphical framework; it rocks! 
            - I'll explain why "code is not enough"; what else we deliver and how we ensure that the code, policies and processes you use, and tell your partners or customers to use, are up to the job.

Or feel confused of those 15 friendly notifications that just shown in your status bar because Google Play just decided to upgrade all of your apps? 
            - This talk does not contain any code. It's a quick overview of the possibilities that the Android platform offers you to serve your users the best experience.

          description:
           - Lots of smart machines, with different operating systems. Lots of smartphones but different development environments. But don't you want to control every single devices as much as possible with just single smartphone.
           - We need to control everything but today it is not possible OR maybe it will! Today's biggest ecosystems are inventing on new web based world. Providers trying to add more HTML5 and other web based solutions into their OS. Also new OS coming with all modern web functions like Tizen and Firefox OS. At the same time, biggest mobile ecosystem provider keeps developing another web based OS and there is nothing can stop them to adopt it to mobile. All these different companies and ecosystems are coming together only in 2 topic. Web and Linux.
           - Oytun Sengul will review architectures and predict future of mobile technologies with development and new Linux kernel prospect.

          title: Gamification in mobile world
          description: 
            - Do you know what gamification means? This old idea has got new strength together with smartphones and tablets market grow. Those two devices have changed the way how the world’s largest companies are trying to reach users. The world of TV, radio and even billboard advertisement is decreasing step by step. Right now the share of those three channels are being slowly taken by mobile applications that are installed on our devices. Your smartphone will tell you when you should change an oil in your car, what ingredients you need to buy for your favourite dinner, and so on.... 
            - Do not you like ads? So maybe something else... Do you want to find out what should you do to make your application successful? 
            - The key for that is to get to know idea of gamification better. During this speech you will be able to learn how to combine techniques known from games with your applications. You should remember that not only the main features are important. You should provide entertainment to users of yours’ applications. 
            - After this lecture you will able to do this. During this speech compressed dose of theory will be presented in an accessible way together with huge number of examples.

          title: Delivering In-vehicle infotainment system based on Tizen and Ford's SmartDeviceLink
          description: 
            - During recent years car manufacturers identified added value for their business models in leveraging mobile connectivity and computation. The idea of smartphone as a main component of the car emerged and various auto makers including Ford and GM opened their environment by providing API not only for usual partners, but also for 3rd party developers willing to provide their own applications for in-car use. The idea of standardized On-board unit drove Samsung, Intel and several supporting entities to build Tizen, an open mobile platform for which In-vehicle infotainment system is one of target use cases.
            - In this presentation I would like to introduce Tizen SDK and Ford's SmartDeviceLink by showing the production process of HTML5 based application for in-car use which takes advantage of target on-board screen, buttons and server in the backend.
            - The presentation will consist of three parts:
              - automotive trends and technology survey
              - Introduction of Tizen SDK and SmartDeviceLink
              - Application development for Tizen IVI (complete process for sample application)

          title: How smart devices shape the world of robotics
          description:  
            - I believe many would agree that smart devices open up a huge amount of use cases, possibilities and opportunities. Now what do you think will happen if you combine a smart device with a machine whose name implies that it should be helpful to man? The only logical thing.
            - Revolution.
            - I am willing to state that this revolution is happening right now and we are part of it. In this talk I'd like to discuss how smart devices have changed the world of robotics, how they helped to make robots more personal and what they can do in the future. If time permits I'd also like to put my robot where my mouth is.

          title: Fungible devices and ubiquitous apps
          description:  
            - In economics, the term ‘fungible’ is used to describe different products/services that are functionally equal. Current mobile devices are not fungible and almost all responsive web and cross-platform development efforts are aimed at this problem. Developers have to choose between web and native solutions, optimized web sites vs responsive website, native apps vs hybrid/cross-platform app, etc. Imagine you could implement a single version of an application using programming language and execution environment of your choice, and be able to make it available on ANY mobile device, maintaining access to device advanced hardware features and holding full control over the UI. I would like to give you an insight into the current research in this area, which could bring us the ability to build not only rich cross-platform applications, but truly ubiquitous applications!

          description:  
            - The relative small number of 120 000 Apps in the BlackBerry App World compared to Android and iOS is for Apps Developers an opportunity because of less competitors and less investment need in marketing effort. Also as it has been proven on several occasions by many independent analysts that BlackBerry users are willing to pay more for the same app in BlackBerry World then on other Platforms. Take this opportunity and develop application for BlackBerry 10 platform.

          description:
            - The main topic of the presentation is developing software for visually impaired people. We want to show our entire way, starting with "why", going though "how" and continuing with"when". We begin with "why", describing our motivation for the project and its purposes. We then describe how we have used the research conducted as a part of iVirtualEye POIG project and its outcomes to create a lever to the success and how iOS mobile platform makes (almost) perfect platform for such task. Then we smoothly move to "when”, revealing details of project timeframe, including initialisation, initial research, production and finally delivering to the market. After this introduction we describe challenges that we met during the project, including technology constraints, issues with getting through the Apple review, target group expectations. 
            - We also present some of our experiences of launching the application to the market, building position, brand awareness, promotion and efforts to gain the market share, based on two of our recently launched applications, SeeingAssistant-Move and SeeingAssistant-Home. We summarise the presentation with our plans for the future, including creating the combined cloud - mobile software ecosystem, a platform for tools and applications dedicated to improve the quality of life of users with sight impairments.
