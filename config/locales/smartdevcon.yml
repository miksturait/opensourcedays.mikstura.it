          description:
           - A few years ago nobody spoke about designing the user experience. In recent years the acronym UX has become a buzzword in the IT world and the demand for UX services is growing dynamically.
           - What do UX designers actually do? Who are they? Where do they come from? How are they different from other people? How do they multiply profits? What is their toolkit? How to talk to them? Why do they love their work and why are they unusually happy?
           - The presentation shall be a stream of impressions radiating a fascination for the discipline.

          description: I will present the features of HTML5 which enable the user to explore websites in the browser without internet access. I will also talk about creating offline applications which ensure supreme user experience. We will consider if it is better to build a suite of native apps for specific platforms or develop just one mobile HTML5-based application as a viable alternative.

            - Have they told you it is dead boring?
            - I shall prove it can be different. You just need to stack the blocks right. It is so simple.

          title:  Don't connect to the 'net, *be* the net! Why are you no ISP yet?
          description:
            - 'While open source democratized access to software and enabled a very successful copy & paste, remix & fork approach to software engineering, there are still two important aspects of our digital infrastructure which are not easily accessible for anyone: open hardware and open networks.'
            - 'However, concerning open networks, some groups already had some successes.'
            - 'More than 10 years ago, in 2003 a couple of initiatives in Austria, Germany, Greece and other countries discovered in parallel that you could "hack-open" standard Wi-Fi routers and install mesh software on them. The combination of hackable cheap Wi-Fi routers and open source thus spund the creation of open networks (often also termed "bottom-up networks" or "community wireless networks"). By inverting the traditional role of ISPs and allowing anyone to be part of a community wireless network, these open networks were born.'
            - 'Now, after ten years of development and research, some of these networks developed and flourished into large communities, covering vast areas. Some other networks dissappeared.'
            - 'However the development of these individual community networks turned out, one thing is clear: mesh networking is here to stay. It is *the* way to do mobile ad-hoc networking for potentially moving networks nodes.'
            - 'The talk will also explain the basics of mesh networking and OLSR.org in particular: how to get it running and experiement with it and how to connect devices over a mesh.'
            - 'But just having a mesh running is only part of the story. You need to connect to the global Internet to become a "real" ISP. There are a couple of steps involved with that and lots of pitfalls. The presenter - also a pioneer of the community wireless network movement - will look back at 10 years of community wireless network development, draw some lessons learned and show a straight forward path to create your own ISP.'
            - 'Next, the presenter will discuss current issues of mesh networking research and point out opportunities for further research.'
            - 'The talk will close with a vision for the next ten years in mesh research and community wireless ISP research.'

            - I will talk about how Red Hat (using JBoss) help their biggest enterprise clients design solutions which simply work well after they have been deployed to production.
            - I will attempt to introduce “infracoding” as a technique which reduces the risk of software failure after the code created by a developer is deployed to a cluster in a data centre or the cloud.
            - I will also try to explain how such open source projects as Fuse Fabric and Docker help transform a developer into a devops.

          description:
            - So you are a programmer and you are lazy (you have to be!). You want your freshly baked code to land on the server without bothering to touch the FTP client (or resorting to a git pull)? You have heard about "continuous integration" and wonder if this is the way to go. This presentation is for you then.
            - I will introduce the concept of “continuous delivery”, which enables you to work more efficiently and guards you against making stupid mistakes. i jej wdrożenie daje +100 do informatycznego lansu na dzielni.

          description:
            - Jolla is a company with roughly 90 employees, headquartered in Helsinki, Finland. In less than 2 years we have put a mobile phone product on the market in November 2013 and a alternative mobile operating system, non-Android based - named SailfishOS, based on a lot of well known open source technologies.
            - This talk serves to present the story behind Jolla the company, what makes our mobile device and Sailfish operating system different from other offerings and introduce some of the open source technologies such as Qt in use and how it's leveraged. In addition to that, some discussions about business possibilities with Sailfish and the powerful concept of The Other Half.

          title: How to create games in a sensible way - early idea validation methods.
          description:
            - Many people are eager to implement their own projects. As it is typical of game development, at first all you know is an overall direction and it is only on the way that important implementation decisions are made.
            - Is there room for optimization under such conditions?
            - " * You should for sure validate your concept against existing solutions."
            - " * And what if there are no such solutions available? "
            - " * Is there anything else you can do? "
            - I would like to share the knowledge and experience I brought from gaming events in San Francisco last year.
            - I would in particular like to explore what can be done to early validate a concept rather than an emerging solution under implementation.

            - The tool should help in particular those NGOs who deliver humanitarian aid in areas affected by armed conflicts. Officers and/or volunteers who go on their first mission in the field need to be trained how to behave in challenging situations. The application presented shall virtually be a simulator of some such life-threatening situations.

Can this system be refined? The not-so-well-known concept of topic maps may very well help us come up with some improvements.
