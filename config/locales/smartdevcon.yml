          title: 180 Degrees East
          description: 
            - For most of the tech world, the Asian market is the new frontier – the region of fast growth and opportunity. A large part of the web world currently seems to evolve around the West, most cutting edge design & technology originates from the US and Europe, whereas the actual user base is spread all over the world and those rather unknown or developing regions offer huge opportunities and potential for growth, especially Asia and its mobile market.
            - My talk will give some insight on the Asian mobile web market, look at mobile & web statistics and user behaviour in comparison to the western world, cultural differences and personal as well as general challenges and pitfalls that I (and others) have encountered along the way.

          title: Sailfish & Mer? Oh, no, not another one!
          description: 
            - Are you asking "Does the market need yet another mobile OS?"Maybe you are interested in what makes it relevant to your device strategy? Or you want to understand (part of) how Jolla can deliver so quickly and efficiently? Of course this is a technology-rich area so you may like a high-level technical perspective. 
            - There will be some background covering Mer's birth, the MeeGo years and how we now work in a truly collaborative and open project to make Mer productisable. The case in point is clearly how Jolla uses Mer in Sailfish. 
            - Mer supports organisational collaboration; our vendor focus drove the design from the project structure through the architecture, the deliverables and the processes. We continuously ask "How will this decision affect vendors using our solution to make a product?" 
            - Mer delivers a world-class platform for building products: after all, it's an ultra-modern Linux stack with a strong upstream focus that partners with Qt, a world-class graphical framework; it rocks! 
            - I'll explain why "code is not enough"; what else we deliver and how we ensure that the code, policies and processes you use, and tell your partners or customers to use, are up to the job.

          title: Brief look over the best (and the worst) UX patterns on Android
          description: 
            - How many times you find yourself trying to download file from Dropbox just to see that awful dialog blocking you from using the app until downloading of your 5GB-worth vacation movie is downloaded? Or feel confused of those 15 friendly notifications that just shown in your status bar because Google Play just decided to upgrade all of your apps? 
            - This talk does not contain any code. It's a quick overview of the possibilities that the Android platform offers you to serve your users the best experience.

          title: Tizen, Firefox OS and the Future of Android
          description:
           - Lots of smart machines, with different operating systems. Lots of smartphones but different development environments. But don't you want to control every single devices as much as possible with just single smartphone.
           - We need to control everything but today it is not possible OR maybe it will! Today's biggest ecosystems are inventing on new web based world. Providers trying to add more HTML5 and other web based solutions into their OS. Also new OS coming with all modern web functions like Tizen and Firefox OS. At the same time, biggest mobile ecosystem provider keeps developing another web based OS and there is nothing can stop them to adopt it to mobile. All these different companies and ecosystems are coming together only in 2 topic. Web and Linux.
           - Oytun Sengul will review architectures and predict future of mobile technologies with development and new Linux kernel prospect.

          description: 
            - As most people are aware, there has been an expansion in mobile banking applications in recent years. The Czech Republic is no exception to this, as nearly all banks have developed a mobile application for their modern mobile operating systems. Although different banks solve their security concepts in different ways, it is possible to discuss typical situations and problems that inevitably appear while designing mobile banking applications.
